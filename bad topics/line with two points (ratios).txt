title: <>line with two points (ratios)<>
question: <>Consider line AD with points B and C on line AD. AB = x__BC. BC = y__CD. If CD = z__, then what does AD equal?<>
type: <>equation<>
variables: x:int:1<50,, y:int:1<50,, z:int:1<50
equation_vars: answer = (x__ + 1) * (y__ + 1) * z__
round: 0
hint: <>answer = (x + 1) * (y + 1) * z <>
reasoning: <>Since AD = AB + BC + CD and AB = x__BC, then AD = x__BC + BC + CD. Because BC = y__CD, AD = x__(y__CD) + y__CD + CD. Finally CD = z__, therfore AD = x__(y__(z__)) + y__(z__) + z__<>

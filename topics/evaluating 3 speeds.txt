title: triathlon

type: equation

question: _name1 entered the annual triathlon last fall. He swam at a rate of _ft ft/s for _mins1 minutes. Then he biked at a rate of _mph mph for _hours hours. Next, he ran at a pace of _mins2 minutes per mile for _mins3 minutes. What is the total distance of the triathlon in miles?

hint: answer = ft * 60 * mins1 / 5280 + mph * hours + mins2 / mins3

reasoning: 

precision: 2

variables: ft~int~2<15  mins1~int~10<5  mph~int~10<30  mins2~int~3<20  mins3~int~10<30~0   hours~equation~m.round(m.pow(_d,1/3),2)  answer~equation~_ft*60*_mins1/5280+_mph*_hours+_mins2/_mins3

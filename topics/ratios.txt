title:combining rates and ratios

type:equation

question:If _name1 can paint a fence in _x hours and _name2 can paint a fence in _y hours. How many hours would it take them to paint _z fences?

hint:answer = z / (1 / x + 1 / y)

reasoning:

round:2

variables:x~int~2<24  y~int~2<24  z~int~2<100  answer~equation~_z / (1 / _x + 1 / _y)



title:sum of the reciprocals (need to fix answer)

type:equation

question:The sum of a and b is _p. The product of a and b is _q. If the sum of the reciprocals of a and b is written as a fraction p/q in simplest form, what is the value of p + q?

hint:answer = (a + b) / (a * b)

reasoning:

round:4

variables:a~int~1<250  b~int~1<250  p~equation~_a + _b  q~equation~_a * _b  answer~equation~_p / _q



title:mixing problems

type:equation

question:A store sells two versions of trail mix:one that is _x% peanuts and one that is _y% peanuts. If you want to make _n pounds of trail mix that is _z% peanuts, how many pounds of the _x% mix will you need?

hint:answer = n - (n * (z - x) / (y - x))

reasoning:

round:2

variables:x~int~0<49  y~int~50<100  n~int~100<1000  z~dep~_x<_y  answer~equation~_n - (_n * (_z - _x) / (_y - _x))



title:ratios in word problems

type:equation

question:A _x-foot piece of rope is cut into two pieces with lengths in a ratio of _y:_z. How many inches long is the second piece?

hint:answer = 12 * z * x / (y + z)

reasoning:

round:2

variables:x~int~10<500  y~int~1<25  z~int~1<25  answer~equation~12 * _z * _x / (_y + _z)



title:line with two points (ratios)

type:equation

question:Condider line AD with points B and C on line AD. AB~equation~_xBC. BC~equation~_yCD. If CD~equation~_z, then what does AD equal?

hint:answer = (x + 1) * (y + 1) * z

reasoning:

round:0

variables:x~int~1<50  y~int~1<50  z~int~1<50  answer~equation~(_x + 1) * (_y + 1) * _z
